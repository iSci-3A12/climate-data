## Data and Materials 
All materials for this assignment may be found in the file: iSci3A12-Climate_Data_Assignment.zip, located in the ```/Content/Individual Assignments/``` folder in Avenue to Learn. Each student has been assigned a monthly temperature dataset, from a different weather station across around the globe--station assignments are listed in ```station_assignments.pdf```.   

Data for each station are found in comma-separated (.csv) files in the ```/data/station_data/``` folder of the zipped file. The selected datasets are of relatively high quality (limited number of missing measurements), and span more than 100 years. Missing monthly values are represented as ```-9999``` in the data. As such, you must decide how to handle bad/missing data to ensure that presented data is accurate, representative, and not misleading.   

To assist you in your analyses, other relevant climate data time series are included in the /data/ directory. Review the document Data_Description.txt for more information on the provided data. A number of information sheets are included in the zipped file--be sure to read through these prior to beginning your assignment.

## Assignment Format Details
You are required to submit a digital report (in .pdf format) containing 3 figures, 1 table, and 2 question responses via Avenue to Learn. You can use the .docx version of the assignment document downloaded from A2L to insert your figures and submit. Your figures must fit within the page margins, and should be of high quality, as outlined in class and in the document Info_Sheet_Plotting_Figures.doc.  Colour is permitted.  

As a final request, you are asked to upload copies of your figures 1 and 2 (along with their captions) to a [Google Form](https://bit.ly/CC2021F-climate-data-figures)â€” the purpose of this is to allow Jay to put together an integrated visualization to be used during an in-class follow-up activity.
