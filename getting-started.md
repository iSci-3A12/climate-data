## Data and Materials 
All materials for this assignment may be found in the file: iSci3A12-Climate_Data_Assignment.zip, located in the ```/Content/Individual Assignments/``` folder in Avenue to Learn. Each student has been assigned a monthly temperature dataset, from a different weather station across around the globe--station assignments are listed in ```station_assignments.pdf```.   

Data for each station are found in comma-separated (.csv) files in the ```/data/station_data/``` folder of the zipped file. The selected datasets are of relatively high quality (limited number of missing measurements), and span more than 100 years. Missing monthly values are represented as ```-9999``` in the data. As such, you must decide how to handle bad/missing data to ensure that presented data is accurate, representative, and not misleading.   

To assist you in your analyses, other relevant climate data time series are included in the /data/ directory. Review the document Data_Description.txt for more information on the provided data. A number of information sheets are included in the zipped file--be sure to read through these prior to beginning your assignment.

## Assignment Format Details
You are required to submit a digital report (in .pdf format) containing 3 figures, 1 table, and 2 question responses via Avenue to Learn. You can use the .docx version of the assignment document downloaded from A2L to insert your figures and submit. Your figures must fit within the page margins, and should be of high quality, as outlined in class and in the document Info_Sheet_Plotting_Figures.doc.  Colour is permitted.  

As a final request, you are asked to upload copies of your figures 1 and 2 (along with their captions) to a [Google Form](https://bit.ly/CC2021F-climate-data-figures)â€” the purpose of this is to allow Jay to put together an integrated visualization to be used during an in-class follow-up activity.

## Scrutinizing your graphs
Not all visualizations are created equal. Just because a chart or map makes sense to you (or has been suggested by sophisticated software) doesn't mean that it will be effective in communicating your message to the intended audience. When creating a visualization, here are a few key considerations to keep in mind:
1. **What is your message?** What information are you trying to communicate to your audience? If you had to summarize the 'point' of the figure in two sentences, what would it be? Keep your message in mind while you design your visualization. 
1. **Who is your intended audience?** For whom are you making this visualization? What do they already understand about the topic or the information that you are presenting? What is the best way to communicate with them?
1. **What is the context?** Where is this visualization being presented? What additional information is being presented alongside it (in the same article, website, etc.)? How much contextualizing information do you need to provide so that the visualization 'stands on its own'?
1. **How will visual elements be interpreted?** The way in which humans interpret visual elements depends on a combination of basic cognitive responses, as well as learned behaviour. As such, it's important to consider that interpretations or responses to visualizations can differ between communities and cultures. For example, think about how the colour red is commonly interpreted: How might the use of red affect the way a visualization is interpreted? 
1. **How can you maximize clarity?** Clarity over content. Your goal when creating a visualization is to convey your message using only the elements that are necessary. This will vary depending on the nature of your *message*, the *intended audience*, the *context*, and the *visual elements* you are using. Approach your visualizations a bit like Marie Kondo: *If an element of your figure does not add to the intended message, simplify it or remove it altogether*.

What are your first impressions of the choropleth? Does it answer the initial question? Will an external audience member understand what this visualization is showing? Does the current choropleth communicate the differences in vaccination rates between provinces and territories?

Take a minute to review the considerations listed above and check out the University of Guelph Library's [visualization design consideration page](https://guides.lib.uoguelph.ca/c.php?g=700755&p=4976239). Does this give you any ideas on how to make your graphic better?
