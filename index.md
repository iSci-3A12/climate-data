## Introduction

As is the case with most science disciplines, analyzing and presenting data is a critical task in climate change science. The ultimate purpose of these activities is to construct and convey information as objectively and clearly as possible. To identify and characterize underlying physical processes, a great deal of data are collected as time series--which are unique from other sampled data in that the order of the observations is an important characteristic. Analyses of time series often focus on variables’ time-related correlation (e.g. trends, cycles, etc.), and results are commonly communicated to external audiences--whether scientific or otherwise—using graphic devices such as charts, graphs, and tables.  

Just as it is important to critically assess the methods used to gain an understanding of a phenomenon, it is equally important to scrutinize the way in which results are presented to the reader through graphics. Creating graphs is to some extent a subjective process, and the choices made in displaying information can significantly impact the audience’s resulting understanding and opinions.

## Objectives
In this assignment, you will work with actual, measured climate data to better understand trends in regional and global climate, while simultaneously improving your analytical and graphic composition skills. Specifically, it is desired that this assignment will:
- provide you with experience and guidance making quality scientific figures;
- increase your appreciation for the importance of figure presentation in conveying a message to an audience;
- familiarize you with climate data and time series analysis; and,
- further your understanding of the nature of global and regional climate change
